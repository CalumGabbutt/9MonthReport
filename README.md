# 9MonthReport

A repository containing video figures from my 9 month PhD report. The figure from the Main Report is taken from our Gut paper ( doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2018-317540 ) and was originally produced by Dr M. Jansen. Both of the figures from the "Critical Review of a Method" are courtesy of Feng, C. Interactive Markov-chain Monte Carlo javascript demo. (2016). https://github.com/chi-feng/mcmc-demo
